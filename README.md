# About this Appliction
This word game is based on Hang-Man and uses Qt for all front-end UI. This game was developed with classmates. A user enters a letter as a guess and tries to guess the "secret" word.
The secret word is randomly chosen from a text file read in by the game. After a certain number of guesses, the user loses the game if the word has not yet been guessed.
